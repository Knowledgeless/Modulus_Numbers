# Modulus_Numbers

I was scrolling on facebook. Suddenlly A post poped up. That was to check, Is a number mod by 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and 10?<br>
Where the mod value will be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9.<p>I thought it would be very interesting to find out using python code. But, I thought it would be more interesting if I can find how many numbers will be in a given range. </p> <h2>That's why I wrote this code.</h2><br>
<h3>Happy_Coding</h3>
